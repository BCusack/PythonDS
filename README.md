# PythonDS
Project instructions for creating Python Data science Data analysis SPA from scratch
## Prerequisites
- [Github Account](https://github.com/) Public/Private repository for hosting and sharing code
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Version control system for tracking changes in code
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE for coding
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Python distribution for managing packages and environments
## Setup Workspace
- Create a Projects/Python file that will contain all working files and the Conda environment.
- Open *Projects/Python* in VSCode by right clicking in the file and "Open with vscode".
- In the extensions panel, install the Python extension.
- In VSCode and ctr+~ to open the terminal `conda create -n env37 python=3.7` . See [Managing Environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
## Create Project
- Open Github and Create a new repository with the name of your project, include *.gitignore* for Python.
- In the local *Projects/Python* open in VSCode **ctr+~** to open the terminal.
- Copy the clone link from Github and in VSCode's terminal type ***git clone***  paste the link and hit enter.
    - This will create a Project file with git initialised.
    - Once finished exit VSCode, open the *Project* file with VSCode.
## Start Environment
*Remember each time to check the environment is active when working with this project.*
- In VSCode terminal type `conda activate env37`.
